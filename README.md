----

**SharpGPT** is a cross-platform library by [FractalTech LLC](https://fractaltech.ru/), offering a wide range of features for working with large language models (LLMs) in C#.

Our API allows you to interact with various models, including ChatGPT from OpenAI, GigaChat from Sber, and many models and agents from our project "FractalGPT." You can perform hallucination checking, perform extractive summarization and text vectorization, and use the function invocation model and search system. To solve your tasks, we also offer modules for working with QAAgent, MathAgent, TextProcessor, and image description.

Tasks addressed by our library include text summarization, conversation management, function invocation, solving mathematical problems, text and document-based Q&A, and image description with the ability to ask questions about images. We aim to provide you with a comprehensive set of tools for working with language models.

SharpGPT will also support the [AI Framework](https://github.com/AIFramework/AIFrameworkOpen), which allows developers to create their own projects based on our client, extending its functionality and adapting it to their tasks using the capabilities of AIFramework, such as training classifiers, neural networks, autoregressive algorithms, and reinforcement learning. It also supports working with images, texts, audio, signals, and more, in addition to ONNX model support.

Join us in our exciting journey into the world of artificial intelligence! We are confident that SharpGPT by FractalTech LLC will become your reliable partner in many of your tasks and projects.

## 🌟 Why C#?

#### 1️⃣ **Performance**
🚀 C# is a compiled programming language, which allows achieving higher performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.

#### 2️⃣ **Integration with the .NET Ecosystem**
🔗 C# is the primary programming language in the .NET ecosystem, providing extensive opportunities for integration with other libraries and infrastructure, such as Unity, XNA, databases, web servers, and more.

#### 3️⃣ **Strong Support and Stability**
🛡️ C# has a long history of development and broad support from Microsoft. This means developers can rely on the language and its tools' stability and reliability, especially important for projects requiring long-term support and development.

#### 4️⃣ **Security**
🔒 C# provides tools to ensure code security, such as strong typing and access control. This allows developers to create reliable and secure applications, including artificial intelligence models.
